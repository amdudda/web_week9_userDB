Follow this tutorial to build an employee database app.

Notice that you use a wrapper called Monk to hide the MongoDB connect callback.

Once you've built the tutorial app, add the ability to update an employee - there's an outline of how to do it at the end of the tutorial.

>"Since this tutorial's already the length of a dictionary, we're going to skip updating, but hopefully you have a solid idea of how to do that. First you'd GET the info and populate a form with it, then you'd PUT on submission of the form (see the beginning of this tutorial for info on POST vs. PUT), and update the table."
